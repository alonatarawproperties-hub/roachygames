You are a senior engineer fixing an existing Expo RN + Node backend project “Roachy Hunt”.
CURRENT BUGS/ISSUES (from screenshots):
- Hunt is still awarding a Roachy (ex: “Scuttler”) with battle stats (HP/ATK/DEF/SPD) and “Assassin/Support” role.
- Egg Inventory stays 0 even after collecting eggs.
- “Uncommon egg” appeared earlier but the Egg Inventory UI only supports Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary.
- Phase I spec must be EGGS ONLY. No Roachy collection in Phase I.

GOAL:
Implement PHASE I (V1) as EGGS-ONLY collection season:
- The only collectible output from hunt is: eggs (common/rare/epic/legendary).
- No roachy entities created.
- No battle stats shown.
- Eggs must be credited correctly to Egg Inventory (counts-based).
- Remove “Uncommon” entirely (map uncommon -> common everywhere).
- Keep the timing ring mini-game (Perfect/Great/Good), but it affects XP/Points only, not roachy stats.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
1) Phase I = EGGS ONLY
   - Hunting a node returns an egg rarity + XP + points + updated pity counters + updated egg counts.
   - DO NOT return roachy name/role/stats in any hunt response.
   - DO NOT write roachies to DB in Phase I.
2) Supported egg rarities ONLY:
   - common, rare, epic, legendary
   - If any code references “uncommon”, convert it to “common”.
3) Single source of truth:
   - Egg counts must live on the server (DB). UI must reflect server state.
4) Fix inventory credit:
   - After claim, server must increment egg counts.
   - Client must refresh or update cache so Egg tab shows correct numbers immediately.
5) Remove/disable Collection tab content:
   - Collection screen should be “Hatching Coming Soon” OR hidden in Phase I.
   - No roachy cards should appear in Phase I.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:

A) Add a feature flag:
- Add config PHASE1_EGGS_ONLY=true (default true).
- In any code path that awards roachies or stats, guard it and disable when PHASE1_EGGS_ONLY is true.

B) Backend: Fix /hunt/claim to award eggs only
- Validate node claim (distance <= 25m, cooldown >= 30s, unique user_id+node_id+day).
- Resolve egg rarity using pity + base rates:
  base rates: common 85%, rare 12%, epic 2.8%, legendary 0.2%
  pity thresholds: rare 20, epic 60, legendary 200
  algorithm:
    increment pity_rare/pity_epic/pity_legendary by 1
    if pity_legendary >= 200 -> award legendary, reset pity_legendary=0
    else if pity_epic >= 60 -> award epic, reset pity_epic=0
    else if pity_rare >= 20 -> award rare, reset pity_rare=0
    else award by base rates
- Update DB: increment egg_{rarity} by 1, update pity, update hunts_today, update streak if needed.
- Return JSON response (exact keys):
{
  "egg_rarity":"common|rare|epic|legendary",
  "xp_awarded": number,
  "points_awarded": number,
  "hunts_today": number,
  "daily_cap": 25,
  "streak_count": number,
  "eggs": {"common":n,"rare":n,"epic":n,"legendary":n},
  "pity": {"rare_in":n,"epic_in":n,"legendary_in":n},
  "warmth": number,
  "recent_drops": ["common","rare",... up to 5]
}
- Ensure any “uncommon” is normalized:
  if resolved rarity == "uncommon" -> treat as "common"
  and ensure DB fields only exist for common/rare/epic/legendary.

C) Backend: Ensure /me returns the same egg counts
- GET /me should return eggs, pity, warmth, hunts_today, streak_count.
- Egg Inventory screen must read from /me (or a single shared endpoint), not from a different local store.

D) Mobile: Replace the “Roachy caught + stats” result UI with “Egg Collected” UI
- After claim, show a modal:
  Title: “Egg Collected!”
  Subtitle: rarity label (color/glow)
  Show XP and points
  Show pity counters updated: Rare in X / Epic in Y / Legendary in Z
  Buttons: “Continue Hunting” (back to map), “Go to Eggs”
- Remove any UI showing:
  roachy name (Scuttler/Leafwing/etc)
  role (Assassin/Support)
  HP/ATK/DEF/SPD
  roachy collection cards in Phase I
- Collection tab:
  Replace with empty state: “Hatching Coming Soon” + explanation.
  Or hide the tab entirely; keep Eggs tab only.

E) Mobile: Fix egg inventory not crediting
- Make Egg Inventory counts sourced only from server:
  - Use TanStack Query for GET /me
  - After successful /hunt/claim, invalidate or update /me query cache immediately so counts update.
- Verify user auth is consistent:
  - Use a single stored token/user_id (SecureStore/AsyncStorage).
  - Ensure claim calls and /me calls use same Authorization header.
  - Add a debug in dev mode that shows user_id on Settings screen.

F) Remove “Uncommon” from UI and enums
- Search project for: "uncommon" and remove/replace with "common"
- If rarity color maps include uncommon, delete it.
- If database enum includes uncommon, migrate it out:
  - Convert any uncommon rows to common
  - Remove uncommon from constraints

G) Sanity logs (temporary, dev only)
- Server logs each claim: user_id, egg_rarity, egg counts before/after
- Client logs: claim response eggs counts and /me eggs counts after invalidation
- Remove verbose logs in final commit.

DELIVERABLE:
- Commit changes that result in:
  1) Phase I hunt produces eggs only
  2) Egg Inventory reflects collected eggs immediately
  3) No Uncommon rarity anywhere
  4) No Roachy stats/collection in Phase I (Collection tab is “Coming Soon”)
  5) Stable /me endpoint as source of truth
