TASK: Fix Android Hunt map smoothness to match iOS. IMPORTANT: iOS is already perfect and must remain unchanged. Make Android-only changes. Do NOT refactor unrelated UI or gameplay. Keep behavior/logic the same on iOS.

CONTEXT:
- iOS Hunt screen is smooth.
- Android Google Maps now loads tiles but gameplay/map feels buggy/stuttery.
- We use expo-location watchPositionAsync with:
  accuracy: BestForNavigation, timeInterval: 1000, distanceInterval: 1
  heading comes from coords.heading (GPS heading).
- MapViewWrapper uses initialRegion only (no controlled region). On Android showsUserLocation=true.
- Marker count is only ~10–20 max, tracksViewChanges=false on most markers.
- Suspected cause: Android Google Maps + frequent playerLocation state updates forcing re-render of Circle/overlays + native blue dot layer.

GOAL:
Reduce Android stutter by decoupling raw GPS updates from React render updates, and avoid the Android native "showsUserLocation" layer stuttering. Keep all logic the same. Only smooth rendering / update frequency on Android.

REQUIRED CHANGES (Android-only):
1) In MapViewWrapper.tsx:
   - Change showsUserLocation to false on Android (keep iOS unchanged).
     Currently: showsUserLocation={IS_ANDROID}
     Make it: showsUserLocation={false} (Android only), iOS stays as before.
   - Do NOT change initialRegion behavior.
   - Do NOT add new libraries.

2) In HuntScreen.tsx (where watchPositionAsync calls updateLocation):
   Implement Android-only throttling + thresholds BEFORE calling updateLocation/setPlayerLocation:
   - Keep raw incoming coords in a ref (latestLocationRef).
   - Only call updateLocation / set state when any is true:
     a) Distance moved >= 5 meters (haversine)
     b) OR heading changed >= 10 degrees (wraparound aware)
     c) OR last state update was > 900ms ago (throttle)
   - If coords.heading is null/invalid (<0), treat as undefined.
   - Keep iOS behavior unchanged (no throttling on iOS).

3) Circle overlay stability:
   - Ensure the home Circle does not "remount" every GPS tick.
   - If Circle uses playerLocation center, ensure center only updates when the throttled state updates (from #2).
   - Do NOT add a changing key. If there is any key, make it constant.

4) Debug verification (Android only):
   - Add minimal logs (guarded so not spammy) to confirm:
     - raw GPS updates arriving
     - throttled state updates frequency (e.g. once per second or when moved >= 5m)
   - Do not add Sentry or crash SDKs.

DELIVERABLE:
- Provide the exact code edits in HuntScreen.tsx and MapViewWrapper.tsx.
- Do NOT modify other files or UI.
- Ensure the Android map remains functional and iOS remains identical.
