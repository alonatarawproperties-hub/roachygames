In `client/components/CameraEncounter.tsx`, keep the current layout and egg behavior. Do NOT implement egg tracking.

Goal: make the AR catching screen feel AAA and less generic by upgrading the VFX + HUD depth in our Obsidian Bronze AR theme.

Implement these FX improvements:

1) PARTICLES (replace random scatter)
- Remove/limit random dot field.
- Add a designed particle system with:
  a) Subtle drifting dust motes (10–20 max) moving slowly diagonally.
  b) A low-count radial particle ring (evenly spaced dots) near the center catch zone, very faint bronze.
  c) Tiny ember specks only near bronze HUD elements, not everywhere.
Particles must be subtle, clean, not noisy.

2) SIGNATURE “SCAN SWEEP”
- Add a faint bronze scan sweep band that crosses the screen every ~2.5s (left→right or top→bottom).
- Use a soft gradient + very subtle noise; opacity low so it feels cinematic.

3) HUD DEPTH STACK
- Add a faint edge vignette (dark) and a very soft blur mask behind HUD.
- Add 4 minimal corner brackets in bronze with micro ticks (thin strokes).
- Keep strokes crisp, 1–1.5px, minimal glow.

4) CENTER “CATCH ZONE” (static, no tracking)
- Add a subtle centered radius circle or bracket frame that pulses slowly (scale/opacity) every ~1.2s.
- This defines the interaction area without following the egg.

5) CTA PANEL UPGRADE
- Upgrade bottom “Tap the egg to catch!” pill:
  - smoked glass background with stronger blur
  - thin bronze border + warm glow
  - optional gentle shine sweep every 3s
- Keep typography consistent with the app.

6) THEME LOCK
- Ensure accents are burnished bronze/amber (not bright yellow gold).
- Put reusable constants in `client/constants/theme.ts` if needed.

Performance:
- Use lightweight Animated/Reanimated; avoid heavy particle counts.
- Maintain smooth 60fps feel.

Deliver:
- Updated CameraEncounter.tsx with improved FX overlays
- Any helper component(s) if needed (e.g., ParticleField, ScanSweep)
- Brief comments on tuning (particle count, opacity, sweep interval)
