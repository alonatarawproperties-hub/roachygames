REPLIT AGENT PROMPT — Roachy Hunt “What Next / FAQ” UI FIX (compact + not broken + more gamified)

Goal
- “What next?” + “FAQ” should NOT consume vertical space above the map.
- The tip/balloon should look gamified (lightweight, “quest hint”), not like a big overlay.
- Opening “What Next?” should NOT be cut/broken. It must render as a proper bottom sheet with safe-area padding + scroll.
- Keep changes minimal and isolated to Hunt UI (no gameplay logic touched).

Primary issues observed (from screenshots)
1) The inline balloon/tip overlay is awkwardly placed and doesn’t feel “game UI”.
2) The “What Next?” bottom sheet opens but is clipped/cut (height/safe area/layout bug).
3) The “What next?” + “FAQ” triggers remain in the same congested area, stealing map space.

Plan (implement exactly)
A) Move triggers to floating “chips” overlaying the map (top-right), NOT inside the header/area-cleared card
B) Replace the “balloon” with a compact “Quest Hint” toast chip (auto-dismiss) that sits above the quest offers row OR near the floating chips
C) Replace the current “What Next?” UI with a safe bottom sheet (Modal + Animated) that:
   - respects Safe Area (bottom inset)
   - has maxHeight (e.g. 70% of screen)
   - uses ScrollView for content
   - never clips text/buttons
   - has close button visible and reachable

————————————————————————————————————————
STEP 1 — Find current implementations
1) In `client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx`, locate:
   - “What next?” button / trigger
   - the balloon/tip component
   - the bottom sheet/modal for What Next + FAQ
   Search keywords: “What next”, “FAQ”, “BottomSheet”, “Modal”, “renderWhatNext”, “tooltip”, “coach”, “hint”.

2) In `client/components/MapViewWrapper.tsx`, confirm you can overlay absolute-positioned UI on top of the map container.

————————————————————————————————————————
STEP 2 — Add floating overlay triggers on map (compact)
In `HuntScreen.tsx`, inside the map container wrapper (the View that contains <MapViewWrapper />),
add a new overlay component rendered ABOVE MapViewWrapper (absolute positioning):

- A small horizontal row at top-right:
  [ What next? ] [ ? ]
- “What next?” is a pill chip (small height)
- “?” is a small circular icon button (FAQ)
- These should not shift layout (position: "absolute").

Example UI spec:
- position: absolute
- top: 12
- right: 12
- zIndex: 50
- gap: 8
- pill height: 32, paddingHorizontal: 12, borderRadius: 16
- use existing theme colors (GameColors / ThemedText)
- subtle glow/shadow like your quest buttons (NOT huge)

Wire actions:
- tapping “What next?” sets `isWhatNextOpen=true`
- tapping “?” sets `isFaqOpen=true`

IMPORTANT:
- Remove/stop rendering the old “What next?” button inside the congested header/card area (or keep but hide it via feature flag). We want ONLY the floating triggers to exist.

————————————————————————————————————————
STEP 3 — Replace balloon with a “Quest Hint Toast” (gamified + tiny)
Remove the current balloon placement (the one showing inside the Area Cleared banner / awkward overlay).

Implement a toast-style hint that:
- appears ONLY when “area cleared” and player has 0–1 spawns, OR after user closes the bottom sheet the first time
- auto-dismisses after 4–6 seconds
- can be dismissed with a small “x”
- is compact: one line + optional icon

Copy guidance text:
- “Quest Hint: Tap eggs to catch • Try Micro/Hot Drop”
(or if quest active: “Quest Hint: Follow the marker • Eggs inside the ring count”)

Placement:
- absolute overlay near top-right under the floating chips OR
- inside the Area Cleared card but as a compact single-line chip (NOT a big balloon)

Implementation detail:
- Use `Animated` fade/slide in (simple, no new libs).
- Keep it within safe bounds: maxWidth: 260, borderRadius: 14, padding: 10.

State:
- `const [hintVisible, setHintVisible] = useState(false);`
- show it based on conditions, then auto-hide with setTimeout
- store a “dismissed” flag in memory for the session (or AsyncStorage later; for now session is fine)

————————————————————————————————————————
STEP 4 — Fix “What Next?” bottom sheet (no clipping)
DO NOT rely on the current broken container.

Implement a reliable sheet using:
- React Native `Modal` + `Animated` slide-up
- `useSafeAreaInsets()` to pad bottom
- `Dimensions.get("window").height` to clamp max height
- `ScrollView` inside for content

Create a new component:
`client/components/hunt/WhatNextSheet.tsx` (or inline in HuntScreen if you prefer, but component is cleaner)

Props:
- `visible: boolean`
- `onClose: () => void`
- `title: string` (e.g. “What Next?” or “FAQ”)
- `children` content

Sheet behavior:
- Backdrop press closes
- Slide up from bottom
- Container style:
  - width: 100%
  - borderTopLeftRadius: 20, borderTopRightRadius: 20
  - backgroundColor: your card color
  - maxHeight: screenHeight * 0.7
  - paddingBottom: insets.bottom + 12
- Header row:
  - left: title
  - right: close “X”
- Body:
  - ScrollView with contentContainerStyle padding: 16

IMPORTANT FIXES (this is what stops “cut”):
- Do NOT use fixed height without maxHeight
- Ensure the sheet container uses `maxHeight`, not `height`
- Ensure ScrollView wraps content
- Ensure header is outside ScrollView
- Ensure bottom padding includes safe area inset

Hook it up:
- `isWhatNextOpen` renders the sheet with “What Next” content
- `isFaqOpen` renders the sheet with FAQ content
- Only one can open at a time:
  - opening FAQ closes WhatNext and vice versa

————————————————————————————————————————
STEP 5 — Content for “What Next” and “FAQ” (keep short + actionable)
“What Next?” sections (bulleted, compact):
1) Catch Eggs
- “Tap nearby egg markers on the map to catch.”
2) Micro / Hot Drop
- “Use Micro for quick nearby spawns.”
- “Use Hot Drop for a bigger radius, limited time.”
3) Quests
- “Follow the quest marker. Eggs inside the quest radius count.”
4) If you see Weak GPS
- “Step outside, wait a few seconds, then try again.”

FAQ entries (very short):
- “Why ‘Weak GPS’?” → “Indoor/low accuracy. Move outside.”
- “Why no spawns?” → “Area cleared. Wait for Home drop timer or start Micro/Hot Drop.”
- “Why can’t I catch?” → “You must be within radius and have a valid spawn.”

————————————————————————————————————————
STEP 6 — Remove old broken UI + verify
1) Remove/hide the old inline “What next?” bottom sheet trigger that was stealing space.
2) Remove/hide the old balloon overlay.
3) Verify in iPhone sizes:
   - iPhone mini / SE (small height)
   - iPhone Pro Max
4) Verify:
   - sheet never clips
   - close button always visible
   - map area is larger (more gamified)
   - floating chips do not block right-side map controls (put chips top-right; controls are mid-right, so OK)

————————————————————————————————————————
Deliverables (must do)
- Code changes in:
  - `client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx` (move triggers, state wiring, remove old balloon)
  - `client/components/hunt/WhatNextSheet.tsx` (new reusable sheet)
  - optional: small styles additions
- No gameplay logic touched
- No new libraries added
- Make sure TypeScript passes

After implementation, add a short note in the console logs:
`console.log("[HuntUI] WhatNextSheet mounted", { visible });`
ONLY for debug; keep minimal.

Go implement now.
