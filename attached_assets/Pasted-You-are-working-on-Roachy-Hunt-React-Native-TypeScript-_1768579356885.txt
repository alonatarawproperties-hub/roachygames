You are working on Roachy Hunt (React Native / TypeScript).

GOAL
Change the map spawn marker icons based on reservation ownership:
- Purple egg marker = RESERVED by ME (known locally)
- Blue egg marker = RESERVED but NOT known locally as mine (treat as "others" in UX)
- Default marker = not reserved

IMPORTANT LIMITATION
Backend does not return reservedBy wallet for a node. Frontend MapNode has:
- status: "AVAILABLE" | "RESERVED" | ...
- reservedUntil: string | null
No reservedBy field.
So "reserved by other" will be inferred as: node is RESERVED but not in local reservedByMe set.

FILES
- client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx
- client/components/MapViewWrapper.tsx
- client/hooks/useMapNodes.ts (type is here)
Do NOT modify HuntLoadingOverlay unless absolutely necessary.

ASSETS
Add 2 PNGs (transparent background) to client/assets/spawns/:
- reserved_by_you.png  (purple)
- reserved_by_other.png (blue)

Create/Update:
- client/assets/spawns/index.ts
  export const SPAWN_RESERVED_BY_YOU = require("./reserved_by_you.png");
  export const SPAWN_RESERVED_BY_OTHER = require("./reserved_by_other.png");

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (minimal diff, no refactors)
1) Track "reserved by me" locally in HuntScreen
- Create a state or ref in client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx:
  const [reservedByMe, setReservedByMe] = useState<Record<string, true>>({});
- When reserve API call succeeds for a nodeId, setReservedByMe(prev => ({...prev, [nodeId]: true}))
- Also, if a node becomes AVAILABLE/EXPIRED or reservedUntil is null or in the past, remove it from reservedByMe (cleanup) so icons revert.
  (Do this in a useEffect that runs when nodes array updates.)

2) Pass reservedByMe to MapViewWrapper
- Add a prop: reservedByMe: Record<string, true>
- Ensure MapViewWrapper rerenders when nodes or reservedByMe changes.

3) Choose marker icon inside MapViewWrapper based on node status + reservedByMe
In client/components/MapViewWrapper.tsx:
- import { SPAWN_RESERVED_BY_YOU, SPAWN_RESERVED_BY_OTHER } from "../assets/spawns";
(or correct relative path based on current structure)
- Add helper:
  const isActiveReserved = (n: MapNode) => {
    if (n.status !== "RESERVED") return false;
    if (!n.reservedUntil) return true; // status says reserved; tolerate missing until
    return new Date(n.reservedUntil).getTime() > Date.now();
  };

- For each node marker, decide icon:
  if (isActiveReserved(node)) {
     if (reservedByMe[node.nodeId]) icon = SPAWN_RESERVED_BY_YOU; else icon = SPAWN_RESERVED_BY_OTHER;
  } else {
     icon = existingDefaultIcon; // keep the current icon logic unchanged
  }

4) Do NOT break presses / reservation flow
- Do not change onPress handlers or hitSlop logic.
- Do not change marker clustering or map press wiring.
- Only swap icon source.

5) Add a tiny debug counter (optional, but helpful)
If HuntScreen already has a debug overlay flag, add:
- reservedByMeCount = number of nodes where isActiveReserved && reservedByMe[nodeId]
- reservedOtherCount = number of nodes where isActiveReserved && !reservedByMe[nodeId]
Display in debug overlay only (no production UI changes).

EDGE CASES TO HANDLE
- If app was reinstalled or reservation was done on another device: it will show BLUE even if it's actually mine. This is expected until backend provides reservedByWallet.
- When reservedUntil passes, marker should revert to default (either by cleanup effect or next refresh).

DELIVERABLES
- Add new assets + exports
- Update HuntScreen to manage reservedByMe and pass prop
- Update MapViewWrapper to select correct icon
- No other unrelated changes

After implementing, write a short note:
- Purple = locally known reserved-by-me
- Blue = reserved but not locally known (others/unknown)
- What would be required to make it truly accurate (backend returning reservedByWallet)

NOW IMPLEMENT.
