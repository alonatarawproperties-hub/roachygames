FIX (PRODUCTION SAFE): "Failed to submit turn" in BattleMatchScreen

ROOT CAUSE
- Client POST body sends `actions: RoachyAction[]`
- Server endpoint destructures `action` (singular), so `action` is undefined
- Server returns 400 "Missing required fields" -> client shows "Failed to submit turn"

GOAL
Make server endpoint accept BOTH formats for backward compatibility:
- action (single object)
- actions (array)
Do NOT change gameplay logic. Do NOT refactor other endpoints.

FILE
- server/battle-routes.ts
  endpoint: POST /api/battles/match/submit-turn  (around line ~707)

REQUIRED CHANGE (SERVER ADAPTS)
1) Update destructuring to read both:
   const { playerId, matchId, action, actions, turnIndex } = req.body;

2) Normalize to a single action object:
   const normalizedAction =
     action ??
     (Array.isArray(actions) ? actions[0] : undefined);

3) Validate required fields using normalizedAction:
   if (!playerId || !matchId || !normalizedAction) {
     return res.status(400).json({ success: false, error: "Missing required fields" });
   }

4) Pass normalizedAction into existing battle engine / submit-turn logic
   Replace any usage of `action` in this handler with `normalizedAction`.

5) Add a tiny debug-safe error message for malformed actions:
   - If actions is provided but empty array, return 400 with:
     { success:false, error:"No actions provided" }

6) OPTIONAL (nice, but safe): support multiple actions later without breaking now
   - If Array.isArray(actions) and actions.length > 1:
     keep current behavior using only the FIRST action for now
     (document in comment: "V1 uses single-action per turn; extra ignored")

DO NOT CHANGE CLIENT YET
- Keep client sending `actions` for now.
- This patch fixes current clients and also supports any older client that might send `action`.

VERIFY
- Start a match
- Submit turn from client
- Endpoint returns 200 success
- No more "Failed to submit turn"
- No regressions to matchmaking or match loading

DELIVERABLE
- Commit only battle-routes.ts changes
- Brief summary of what changed and why (server now accepts both `action` and `actions`)
