REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (COPY ALL)

Goal: Make BattleMatchScreen LOOK like a real battle arena (Axie-like) with placeholder assets.
IMPORTANT: UI/UX ONLY. Do NOT change backend, matchmaking, battle logic, submit-turn payloads, or state machine logic.
Keep existing action selection + lock-in flow. Just re-skin and reorganize visuals.

Must deliver:
- Arena background (parallax-ish layers + vignette + particles light)
- Big “ACTIVE ROACHY” fighters in the center (left & right) with:
  - portrait/sprite placeholder
  - HP bar above
  - small status chips (Alive/KO, class)
  - idle bob animation
  - hit feedback animation (shake + red flash overlay) when hp decreases
- Replace action buttons with “Skill Cards” row that looks like Axie cards:
  - 3 cards (Basic, Skill A, Skill B) + 2 smaller utilities (Guard, Focus)
  - Each card shows: name, type badge, cooldown number, small icon placeholder
  - Disabled state when on cooldown or roachy dead
  - Selected state glow
- Add Turn UI polish:
  - Turn timer ring/pulse
  - “Lock In” becomes a gold CTA with progress state “Waiting…”
- Landscape only for BattleMatchScreen (lock orientation on mount, unlock on unmount)

FILES:
1) Create: client/components/battle/ArenaBackground.tsx
2) Create: client/components/battle/RoachyFighter.tsx
3) Create: client/components/battle/SkillCard.tsx
4) Modify: client/screens/BattleMatchScreen.tsx (layout + animations + orientation lock)
Keep changes isolated so other screens aren’t affected.

-----------------------------------------
1) ArenaBackground.tsx
-----------------------------------------
Create a layered arena background with depth:
- Base: dark gradient + vignette
- Mid: subtle blurred shapes (SVG circles/ellipses)
- Fore: light particles (tiny dots) with slow Animated opacity drift
Use react-native-linear-gradient if already installed; if not, use View backgrounds with rgba + overlays.
Export <ArenaBackground/>.

-----------------------------------------
2) RoachyFighter.tsx
-----------------------------------------
Create component:
<RoochyFighter side="left|right" roachy={BattleRoachy} isActive hpDeltaTriggerKey />

Features:
- Portrait placeholder: large rounded rectangle with class color border + big monogram (first letter of name)
- Idle bob: Animated translateY (loop)
- When hp decreases: trigger shake + red flash overlay (store prev hp in ref; compare)
- HP bar above portrait with smooth Animated width
- Under portrait: ATK/DEF/SPD line
- Status chips: "ALIVE" or "KO" + class label

Do not require actual images; placeholders are fine.

-----------------------------------------
3) SkillCard.tsx
-----------------------------------------
Create card UI like Axie:
Props: title, typeLabel, cooldown, disabled, selected, onPress
Layout:
- Top row: icon placeholder circle + title
- Middle: type badge (PIERCE/FOCUS/GUARD/etc)
- Bottom: cooldown pill (e.g. "CD 2") or "READY"
Style:
- Glass card background (rgba 0.08)
- Border glow when selected
- Greyed when disabled
Add micro press animation (scale down/up).

-----------------------------------------
4) BattleMatchScreen.tsx layout upgrade
-----------------------------------------
KEEP your existing logic for:
- selecting roachy
- selecting actions
- lock in submit
- finisherReady, isLocked, etc.

But replace visuals:
- Whole screen background: <ArenaBackground />
- Top bar remains, but add nicer pill containers.

Main battle row (landscape):
LEFT COLUMN (team list):
- Keep your team list cards but tighten spacing and add small portrait monogram to each.

CENTER COLUMN (battle stage):
- Show two big fighters facing each other:
  - <RoachyFighter side="left" roachy={playerActive} />
  - Center “VS” target icon with pulsing ring
  - <RoachyFighter side="right" roachy={opponentActive} />
- Under fighters: “Target selected: {enemy.name}” + hint

RIGHT COLUMN (enemy list):
- Keep enemy list but also show small “tap to target” label.

BOTTOM BAR:
- Replace old action buttons area with cards.
When selectedRoachy is alive:
  Row 1 (main): Basic, Skill A, Skill B (SkillCard big)
  Row 2 (utility small): Guard, Focus (+ Finisher if ready)
Lock In button stays on the far right as big gold CTA.

Orientation lock:
- Use expo-screen-orientation (already in expo ecosystem).
In BattleMatchScreen:
  on mount -> lock to LANDSCAPE
  on unmount -> unlock / restore to DEFAULT

If expo-screen-orientation is not installed, add it and update app.json if needed.
But keep code minimal and contained in BattleMatchScreen.

-----------------------------------------
QUALITY BAR (must hit):
- The center must feel like “two fighters in an arena”, not two info boxes.
- Must include idle animation and hit feedback.
- Skill selection must feel like card game selection.
- No logic changes; only UI and animations.

Deliver with working build; no TS errors; no missing imports.
If any dependency is missing, explicitly add install command notes in your output.
