TASK: Add Roachy Hunt in-game guides (mini tutorial + contextual tips + FAQ + “What next?” helper) WITHOUT breaking existing hunt logic.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change any server routes, DB schema, spawn logic, catch logic, or map marker logic.
- Client-only changes only.
- Keep UI lightweight: bottom sheets / tooltips / small banner messages.
- Avoid spam: each tip should show max 2-3 times then stop.
- All “seen” + counters must persist on device using AsyncStorage (not SecureStore).
- Must work on iOS TestFlight build (Expo RN). No new native modules.

FILES YOU WILL EDIT / ADD ONLY:
- client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx (wire UI + triggers)
- client/context/HuntContext.tsx (expose meta needed if missing)
- client/components/hunt/HuntCoachmarks.tsx (NEW)
- client/components/hunt/HuntHelpSheet.tsx (NEW)
- client/components/hunt/HuntFaqModal.tsx (NEW)
- client/lib/huntGuides.ts (NEW: persistence + tip rules)
- client/styles (optional new styles file) OR inline styles in components
- If a BottomSheet component already exists in project, reuse it. If not, implement simple Modal with Pressable overlay.

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1) FIRST-TIME ONBOARDING (Coachmarks)
- Show only on first entry to HuntScreen after login.
- Steps (simple overlays with “Next”, “Skip”, “Don’t show again”):
  S1: “Welcome to Roachy Hunt” (what you do)
  S2: Highlight radius/circle area: “Eggs inside your radius can be caught”
  S3: Highlight an egg marker (if any spawns exist): “Tap an egg to catch”
  S4: Highlight inventory/egg counter: “Eggs stack here”
  S5: Highlight pity section/button: “Pity = guaranteed rarities after enough catches”
  S6: Highlight Area Cleared banner (if spawns low) OR show fallback text: “When cleared: wait for Home Drop timer or Explore by walking”
- If there are no spawns when onboarding runs, skip S3 and show text-only.
- Persist state key: hunt_onboarding_completed = true.

2) “WHAT NEXT?” Helper (Bottom Sheet)
- Add a small button near top-right or under banner: “What next?”
- Opens a bottom sheet/modal with dynamic guidance derived from existing state:
  - If spawns.length >= 2: “Catch eggs in your radius.”
  - Else (area cleared): show “Next Home Drop in: {home.nextTopUpInSec formatted}”
  - If meta.quest.active: show “Quest live: {type} • {distanceM}m {direction} • {expiresInSec} left”
  - Show 1 best recommendation line:
     - If area cleared and home timer > 0: “Wait for Home Drop or walk 200–500m to find Explore spawns.”
     - If quest active: “Head toward the quest marker on the map.”
- Must not block gameplay, just info.

3) CONTEXTUAL TIPS (Non-spam)
Implement a tiny tip engine that shows a toast/snackbar/banner message based on triggers:
- Tip A: Area cleared (spawns.length < 2) -> show “Area Cleared ✅ Next Home Drop in {time}. Walk to Explore for more.”
- Tip B: Pity close -> when pity.epicIn <= 5 show “Epic pity soon 👀 {epicIn} catches to guaranteed Epic.”
- Tip C: Quest active -> show once per quest key: “Quest live on map. Follow the marker.”
Rules:
- Each tip has a per-user counter stored locally: max 3 displays, then stop.
- Use AsyncStorage keys like:
  hunt_tip_counts = JSON
  hunt_last_tip_ts = number
  hunt_seen_quest_keys = JSON set
- Add a 20s global cooldown between tips so they don’t chain.

4) FAQ / HELP MODAL
- Add a “?” icon in HuntScreen header area.
- Opens modal with sections:
  - Basics: What are Mystery Eggs?
  - Spawns: Home vs Explore vs Quest (Hot Drop / Hotspot / Beacon)
  - Pity Counter: Guaranteed rare/epic/legendary after thresholds (display current configured thresholds if available; else static text)
  - Warmth/Streak: what it does (short)
  - GPS: why location jumps / accuracy matters
- Keep answers 2–4 lines each.

5) QUEST MARKER DISCOVERY FIX (UI only)
- If meta.quest.active is true, ensure the UI explains: “Quest marker is on the map — zoom out if you don’t see it.”
- Add inside the Area Cleared banner (existing renderAreaClearedBanner) a line when quest active:
  “Quest marker placed • Zoom out if needed.”

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

A) Create helper library client/lib/huntGuides.ts
Export:
- getBool(key), setBool(key, val)
- incrementTipCount(tipId): returns newCount
- canShowTip(tipId, cooldownMs): returns boolean
- markTipShown(tipId)
- hasSeenQuestKey(key), markQuestKeySeen(key)
Use AsyncStorage:
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
If not installed, add it via package.json and npm install. (But first check if it already exists.)

B) Coachmarks Component (client/components/hunt/HuntCoachmarks.tsx)
Props:
- visible: boolean
- steps: Array<{ id, title, body, anchor?: {x,y,width,height} | null }>
- onClose(): void
- onComplete(): void
Implementation:
- Use Modal with semi-transparent overlay.
- If anchor provided: draw a highlight box (border) + tooltip card near it.
- If no anchor: center tooltip.
Anchors:
- For simplicity (safe), use React refs + measure() on key UI elements in HuntScreen:
  - radius container / map container
  - inventory button
  - pity button/panel
  - banner container
If measuring is hard due to MapView, provide text-only step for map/radius.

C) HuntHelpSheet Component (client/components/hunt/HuntHelpSheet.tsx)
Props: open, onClose, derivedData { spawnsCount, homeNextTopUpInSec, questActive, questType, distanceM, direction, expiresInSec }
Simple modal bottom sheet UI with 3 blocks: “Status”, “Best next step”, “Tips”.

D) HuntFaqModal (client/components/hunt/HuntFaqModal.tsx)
Simple scrollable modal.

E) Wire into HuntScreen.tsx
- Add state:
  const [showCoachmarks, setShowCoachmarks] = useState(false);
  const [showHelp, setShowHelp] = useState(false);
  const [showFaq, setShowFaq] = useState(false);
- On mount:
  - check AsyncStorage hunt_onboarding_completed; if false -> setShowCoachmarks(true)
- Add buttons:
  - “What next?” and “?” near header.
- Add contextual tip triggers using useEffect watching:
  - spawns.length
  - huntMeta?.home?.nextTopUpInSec
  - huntMeta?.quest?.active, huntMeta?.quest?.key
  - pity object from last catch response if already in state; if pity not globally stored, skip pity tip for now OR store last pity in HuntContext when catch returns.
Tip display:
- If you already have a Toast component, reuse it.
- If not, implement a minimal in-screen banner that animates in/out (use Animated, 2.5s duration).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1) Opening Hunt first time shows coachmarks; subsequent opens do not.
2) Tips show only when relevant and not more than 3 times per tip.
3) “What next?” sheet always opens and shows correct status text.
4) FAQ modal opens and is readable.
5) No changes to spawn/catch/server logic; app still hunts normally.

TEST PLAN (manual):
- Fresh install -> open Hunt -> coachmarks appear -> complete -> close -> reopen -> no coachmarks.
- Clear spawns -> see Area Cleared banner -> tip A shows (max 3 times).
- Trigger quest active -> banner shows “zoom out” line + tip C once per quest.
- Tap “What next?” -> correct dynamic recommendations.
- Tap “?” -> FAQ opens.

NOW IMPLEMENT. After code changes:
- Provide exact file diffs / snippets for each new file.
- Run TypeScript checks / lint if available.
- Ensure imports and paths use existing alias convention (@/).
