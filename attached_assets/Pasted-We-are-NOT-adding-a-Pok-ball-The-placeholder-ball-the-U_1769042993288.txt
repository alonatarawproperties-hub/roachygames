We are NOT adding a Pokéball. The “placeholder ball” the UI shows is the catch indicator/reticle: it currently comes from Feather target + generic lasso gradient. Replace those with our AAA “Relic Catcher Disc” (bronze ring + obsidian glass lens) and a themed lasso.

FILE: client/components/CameraEncounter.tsx

CURRENT (from our file):
- Mystery Egg image stays the same (player taps the egg).
- Net/Target uses Feather target icon (lines ~598-602).
- Lasso uses LinearGradient with ["#FFD700", "#FF8C00", "#FF6B00"] (lines ~604-617).

GOAL:
- Remove the generic/placeholder feel.
- Replace Feather target icon with a premium catcher disc PNG (transparent).
- Theme the lasso to “ResinGlass Relic” (bronze + obsidian), no neon/game-jam look.
- Keep egg locked in place (no tracking movement). Only FX/opacity/scale pulses.

ASSETS (add these manually to the repo):
Create folder: client/assets/ui/
Add:
1) relic_catcher_disc.png  (transparent PNG, 1024 or 2048)
Optional (for better layering):
2) relic_disc_glow.png (soft warm glow blob, transparent)

THEME CONSTANTS:
In client/constants/theme.ts export:
export const RELIC = {
  bronze: "#C8893A",
  bronzeDeep: "#7A4B1C",
  obsidian: "rgba(10,10,12,0.72)",
  obsidianDeep: "rgba(0,0,0,0.85)",
  warmGlow: "rgba(200,137,58,0.40)",
  glassEdge: "rgba(255,255,255,0.12)",
} as const;

1) REPLACE NET/TARGET ICON WITH DISC IMAGE
In the Net/Target block, remove:
<Feather name="target" size={60} color={GameColors.primary} />

Replace with:
<Image
  source={require("@/assets/ui/relic_catcher_disc.png")}
  style={styles.relicDisc}
  resizeMode="contain"
/>

If we add relic_disc_glow.png, render it behind as an absolutely-positioned Image with low opacity.

2) ADD AAA IDLE MOTION (LIGHTWEIGHT)
Use Animated.loop with useNativeDriver for opacity/scale only:
- Disc pulse: opacity 0.65 <-> 1.0 over 2200ms
- Disc micro scale: scale 1.0 <-> 1.04 over 2200ms
- Optional glow pulse slightly offset timing

No random movement, no drifting, no rotation required.

3) THEME THE LASSO (NO GENERIC GOLD/ORANGE)
Keep the lasso structure but change gradient colors to bronze/obsidian premium:
Replace:
colors={["#FFD700", "#FF8C00", "#FF6B00"]}

With something like:
colors={[RELIC.bronzeDeep, RELIC.bronze, "rgba(255,255,255,0.20)"]}

Also reduce “cartoony” glow intensity:
- lassoGlow should be softer (lower opacity)
- lassoRing border should be thinner and cleaner
- overall lasso should read as “relic energy” not “generic fire”

4) STYLING (ADD/UPDATE STYLES)
Add:
relicDisc: {
  width: 78,
  height: 78,
}
Optionally wrap it in a subtle glass pad:
backgroundColor: RELIC.obsidian,
borderColor: RELIC.glassEdge,
borderWidth: 1,
borderRadius: 999,
padding: 10,
with soft shadow/elevation.

5) PERFORMANCE
- Use Image PNGs (no SVG).
- Animated transforms + opacity only (native driver).
- Don’t add blur filters.

DELIVERABLE
- Updated CameraEncounter.tsx with Feather target removed and replaced by relic_catcher_disc.png
- Lasso gradient updated to bronze/obsidian
- Idle pulse animation added to disc (and optional glow)
- Add the new RELIC theme constants in theme.ts
- Leave the Mystery Egg tap behavior unchanged
