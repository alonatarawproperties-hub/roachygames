You are fixing ONLY BUG C in Roachy Hunt:

BUG C: UI says “No eggs in range” even when a spawn marker is visible inside the radius circle / feels like it should be in range. User confusion: which radius is this? scan vs catch? Also the “Reserve” sheet shows distance (ex: 30m) but the header banner still says no eggs in range.

Goal:
1) Make radius logic CONSISTENT across: 
   - “No eggs in range” banner
   - Spawn “in range” filtering / enable interactions
   - Bottom sheet distance display
   - Map radius circle visualization
2) Make the UI UNAMBIGUOUS by showing TWO radii:
   - SCAN radius (spawns you can SEE on map) e.g. 500m
   - CATCH radius (spawns you can ACT on / reserve / open encounter) e.g. 30m
3) Fix any mismatch caused by using different location sources or different distance formulas.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change server endpoints.
- Do NOT refactor big architecture.
- Minimal edits, just enough to fix BUG C.

---------------------------------------
STEP 0 — Find where these are defined/used
---------------------------------------
Search the codebase for:
- "No eggs in range"
- "inRange"
- "radius"
- "500" and "30" in hunt/map logic
- any distance function (haversine, getDistance, metersBetween, etc)

You will likely touch:
- client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx (banner + list state)
- client/components/MapViewWrapper.tsx (circle radius drawing)
- whichever file computes spawn distance (often a util or hook like useSpawns/useHuntSpawns)

---------------------------------------
STEP 1 — Create ONE source-of-truth distance function
---------------------------------------
Create (or reuse if exists) a single util function returning METERS:

function distanceMeters(aLat:number,aLng:number,bLat:number,bLng:number) {
  const R = 6371000;
  const toRad = (v:number)=> (v*Math.PI)/180;
  const dLat = toRad(bLat-aLat);
  const dLng = toRad(bLng-aLng);
  const lat1 = toRad(aLat);
  const lat2 = toRad(bLat);
  const x = Math.sin(dLat/2)**2 + Math.cos(lat1)*Math.cos(lat2)*Math.sin(dLng/2)**2;
  return 2*R*Math.asin(Math.sqrt(x));
}

Then REPLACE any other “meters” calculations used for spawns/range with this function (do not leave multiple formulas).

---------------------------------------
STEP 2 — Unify which player location is used (no stale mismatch)
---------------------------------------
Create a helper that returns the BEST current location, used everywhere:

const getBestPlayerLoc = () => {
  const ref = playerLocationRef?.current;
  if (ref?.latitude && ref?.longitude) return { latitude: ref.latitude, longitude: ref.longitude };
  if (playerLocation?.latitude && playerLocation?.longitude) return { latitude: playerLocation.latitude, longitude: playerLocation.longitude };
  return null;
};

Use getBestPlayerLoc() for:
- banner “No eggs in range”
- in-range filtering
- bottom sheet distance
- map circle center (if circle is meant to be around player)

Do NOT compute range using one location source and distance using another.

---------------------------------------
STEP 3 — Define explicit constants for BOTH radii
---------------------------------------
In ONE place near the hunt UI logic (HuntScreen is fine):

const SCAN_RADIUS_M = 500;   // what we query/show on map
const CATCH_RADIUS_M = 30;   // what counts as “in range” for actions (Reserve / Catch)

If your game uses a different catch radius, keep that exact value, but make it a named constant and use it everywhere.

---------------------------------------
STEP 4 — Fix the banner logic (this is the main bug)
---------------------------------------
Currently banner likely does something like:
  show “No eggs in range” if spawnsInRange.length === 0

Ensure spawnsInRange means CATCH RANGE ONLY:
- spawnsVisible = spawns where distance <= SCAN_RADIUS_M
- spawnsCatchable = spawnsVisible where distance <= CATCH_RADIUS_M

Then:
- If spawnsVisible.length === 0 -> show “No eggs nearby (scan radius 500m)”
- Else if spawnsCatchable.length === 0 -> show “No eggs within 30m — move closer”
- Else -> show normal state (or nothing)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use map circle to imply catch range if it’s scan range.
Make the text match the radius used.

Change the text:
Replace “No eggs in range” with one of these (pick the best UX):
Option A (simple):
  “No eggs within 30m — move closer”
Option B (more explicit):
  “Eggs shown within 500m. Catch range: 30m.”

---------------------------------------
STEP 5 — Draw TWO circles so user stops thinking it’s a bug
---------------------------------------
In MapViewWrapper (or wherever the circle overlay is rendered):
- Draw scan circle (500m) as faint
- Draw catch circle (30m) as stronger
Both centered on getBestPlayerLoc().

If you already draw one circle today, confirm what it represents:
- If it represents SCAN radius: keep it but label it via UI hint.
- Add the smaller CATCH circle so it’s obvious why an egg can be visible but not catchable.

Implementation example for react-native-maps Circle:
<Circle center={playerLoc} radius={SCAN_RADIUS_M} ... />
<Circle center={playerLoc} radius={CATCH_RADIUS_M} ... />

If you are not using <Circle>, replicate the same concept with whatever overlay you use.

---------------------------------------
STEP 6 — Make “Reserve” button/state use the same catchable check
---------------------------------------
Wherever you enable Reserve or open the encounter:
- Use spawnsCatchable based on distanceMeters + getBestPlayerLoc + CATCH_RADIUS_M
- Do not allow one path to compute distance differently.

Add a single debug log (temporary) to verify:
console.log("[RANGE] loc=", playerLoc, "spawn=", spawn.id, "d=", d, "catchable=", d<=CATCH_RADIUS_M);

---------------------------------------
STEP 7 — Acceptance tests (must pass)
---------------------------------------
1) If an egg marker is visible inside 500m but farther than 30m:
   - Banner must NOT say generic “No eggs in range”
   - It must say “No eggs within 30m — move closer” (or equivalent)
   - Map shows big (500m) + small (30m) circles.

2) If an egg is within 30m:
   - Banner should not warn “no eggs within 30m”
   - Reserve/Catch works and distance shown matches the same formula.

3) If there are truly no eggs in 500m:
   - Banner indicates none nearby (scan radius), not catch radius.

Deliverable:
- Commit minimal changes to the 2–3 relevant files.
- Do not touch server code.

Start now and implement.
