PROD FIX: Refresh exploit — /api/hunt/spawn creates 15 new eggs every tap

CURRENT:
- Client spawnCreatures() POSTs /api/hunt/spawn with count=15
- Server unconditionally inserts count spawns
- Refresh calls spawnCreatures(), so infinite eggs (not sustainable)

GOAL:
Convert /api/hunt/spawn into ENSURE behavior:
- Only create spawns if active uncaught spawns in radius is below TARGET
- Create only the missing amount
- Add cooldown per wallet to prevent spam
Then update client refresh to NOT call spawnCreatures.

==================================================
SERVER PATCH (hunt-routes.ts)
==================================================
1) Read walletAddress from header "x-wallet-address" (preferred), fallback to req.body.walletAddress.
2) Compute radius bbox same as GET /api/hunt/spawns (default 500m).
3) Count active uncaught spawns in radius:
   conditions:
   - isActive = true
   - caughtByWallet IS NULL
   - expiresAt > now
   - lat/lng within bbox
4) TARGET = 12 (or 15) spawns per player radius.
5) missing = max(0, TARGET - activeCount)
6) Cooldown: 60 seconds per wallet.
   Implement v1 using an in-memory Map on globalThis:
   const cd = (globalThis as any).__huntSpawnCooldown ??= new Map<string, number>();
   const last = cd.get(wallet) || 0;
   if (Date.now() - last < 60_000 && missing > 0) return { success:true, created:0, reason:"cooldown", activeCount };
   If missing > 0 and cooldown ok, cd.set(wallet, Date.now()).
7) Spawn only `missing` (ignore client-provided count).
8) Return: { success:true, created: missing, activeCount: activeCount + created, spawns: createdSpawns }

IMPORTANT:
- Do not allow user to force count=15 anymore.
- Keep existing spawn generation logic for egg rarity etc.

==================================================
CLIENT PATCH (HuntContext.tsx + HuntScreen.tsx)
==================================================
A) In HuntScreen refresh handler:
Remove spawnCreatures() call.
Refresh should ONLY:
- refreshSpawns() (refetch GET /api/hunt/spawns)
- refetchMapNodes()
- haptics

B) Ensure spawns exist on entering Hunt:
Call spawnCreatures() ONCE when Hunt screen mounts OR when playerLocation becomes available.
But rename behavior mentally: it now calls ENSURE endpoint.
Also send wallet header:
apiRequest POST should include wallet in header OR include walletAddress in body.

If apiRequest can’t set headers, include walletAddress in body and also update server fallback.

ACCEPTANCE:
1) Spam refresh 20x -> created spawns should NOT increase endlessly.
2) If area has 0 spawns, the first ensure call creates up to TARGET.
3) After that, ensure returns created=0 until spawns expire or are caught.
4) Catching reduces activeCount; ensure can top up only when below target and cooldown passed.
