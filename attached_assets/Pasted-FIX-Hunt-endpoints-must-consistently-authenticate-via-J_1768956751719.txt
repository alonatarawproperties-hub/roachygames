FIX: Hunt endpoints must consistently authenticate via JWT.
Bug proof: Debug overlay shows GET /api/hunt/spawns returns Err: "Wallet address required".
This means server is not receiving/using JWT for /spawns.

GOAL:
1) Ensure apiRequest ALWAYS attaches Authorization header when a token exists (including GET).
2) Ensure server /api/hunt/spawns REQUIRES auth and returns 401 if missing (not 200 with error).
3) Add server log line for /spawns showing whether playerId was detected.
4) Update debug overlay to show whether Authorization header was actually set (not just token existence).

CHANGES:

A) CLIENT: locate apiRequest() (client/lib/api.ts or similar)
- Build headers like this for ALL methods:

const headers: Record<string,string> = { Accept: "application/json" };
if (body != null) headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json";

const token = await getAuthTokenSomehow(); // use existing token retrieval
const authHeaderSet = !!token;
if (token) headers["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${token}`;

IMPORTANT: do NOT gate Authorization by method. It must be added for GET too.

- When calling fetch(url, opts), pass headers in opts ALWAYS:
const res = await fetch(fullUrl, { method, headers, body: body ? JSON.stringify(body) : undefined });

- In the global debug object (__lastApiDebug), record:
hasAuthToken: !!token
authHeaderSet: authHeaderSet
authHeaderPreview: token ? token.slice(0,8) + "..." : null  (optional)

B) SERVER: in server/hunt-routes.ts for GET /api/hunt/spawns
- At the top of the handler, enforce auth:

const playerId = getPlayerId(req);
if (!playerId) return res.status(401).json({ error: "UNAUTHORIZED" });

(If getPlayerId currently throws, wrap it and return 401.)
- Add log:
console.log("[SPAWNS] auth", { hasAuth: !!req.headers.authorization, playerId: playerId ?? null });

- Make sure middleware that parses JWT runs for GET routes too.
If your auth middleware is only applied to POST, move it to app.use("/api", authMiddleware) so it applies to GET /api/hunt/spawns as well.

C) DEBUG OVERLAY:
- Show:
Auth Token Exists: YES/NO
Authorization Header Set: YES/NO
Auth Header Preview: abcdef12...
So we can confirm header is actually sent.

TEST:
1) Force close TestFlight app
2) Open Hunt, show debug overlay
3) Trigger spawns refresh
Expected:
- Status 200
- Err should be "-" (no wallet required error)
- Server logs should show [SPAWNS] auth ... playerId=...

Deliver: provide exact diffs for apiRequest, hunt-routes.ts, and HuntDebugOverlay.
