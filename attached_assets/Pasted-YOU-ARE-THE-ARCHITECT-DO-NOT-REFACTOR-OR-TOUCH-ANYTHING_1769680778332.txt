YOU ARE THE ARCHITECT. DO NOT REFACTOR OR TOUCH ANYTHING NOT MENTIONED. iOS IS PERFECTLY WORKING AND MUST REMAIN 100% UNCHANGED. ONLY FIX ANDROID MARKER VISUALS + ANDROID PERFORMANCE ISSUES CAUSED BY MARKER RENDERING.

CONTEXT:
- iOS map looks correct: small golden egg markers + cohesive assets.
- Android shows: (1) MASSIVE chrome “?” player egg marker taking half screen, (2) orange default pins for spawns.
- Root cause: Android react-native-maps Marker renders bitmap markers at native pixel size; our marker assets are huge (mystery-egg.png ~2.2MB, egg assets 1–2.3MB). Also several markers still render children (<Image>/<View>) which is fragile on Android and can fallback to default pins.

GOAL:
- Android: Use Marker “image” prop with PRE-SIZED marker bitmaps (64px or 72px) for ALL markers that currently render children. Do NOT render Marker children on Android.
- iOS: Keep current behavior exactly the same (children-based markers and PlayerMarkerView heading wedge etc).
- Fix: Spawn markers must show our egg pin art (not orange pins). Player marker must be proportional (not huge).

STEP 1 — ADD NEW SMALL MARKER ASSETS (NO DESIGN CHANGE, JUST RESIZE):
Create new files (same art, resized):
- client/assets/hunt/spawn-marker-72.png
- client/assets/hunt/mystery-egg-72.png
Optional (if you want crisp on high DPI): also add -96 versions, but default to 72.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not use the 2.2MB mystery-egg.png directly on Android marker image prop.
- We keep existing large assets for other screens. These new small files are only for map markers.

STEP 2 — MapViewWrapper.tsx: ADD ANDROID MARKER IMAGE CONSTANTS
Near top where spawnMarkerImage is defined, add:

const IS_ANDROID = Platform.OS === "android";

// Existing (keep):
const spawnMarkerImage = require("@/assets/hunt/spawn-marker.png");

// New Android-sized bitmaps:
const spawnMarkerImageAndroid = require("@/assets/hunt/spawn-marker-72.png");
const playerMarkerImageAndroid = require("@/assets/hunt/mystery-egg-72.png");

STEP 3 — FIX PLAYER MARKER BLOCK (lines ~566-577)
Current Android is rendering a massive child view (PlayerMarkerView). We keep it on iOS only.
Replace block with:

{hasLocation && MarkerComponent ? (
  <MarkerComponent
    coordinate={{
      latitude: playerLocation.latitude,
      longitude: playerLocation.longitude,
    }}
    anchor={{ x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }}
    flat={true}
    tracksViewChanges={false}
    tappable={false}
    {...(IS_ANDROID ? { image: playerMarkerImageAndroid } : {})}
  >
    {/* iOS unchanged: keep existing custom wedge + heading view */}
    {!IS_ANDROID ? <PlayerMarkerView heading={playerLocation.heading} /> : null}
  </MarkerComponent>
) : null}

DO NOT change PlayerMarkerView implementation. Just gate it off for Android.

STEP 4 — FIX SPAWN MARKERS (Golden mystery eggs) BLOCK
For Android, do NOT render <Image> child. Use image prop.
Update the marker return to:

return (
  <MarkerComponent
    key={spawn.id}
    identifier={spawn.id}
    coordinate={{ latitude: spawnLat, longitude: spawnLng }}
    onPress={() => safeOnSpawnTap(spawn, "marker")}
    onSelect={() => safeOnSpawnTap(spawn, "marker")}
    anchor={{ x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }}
    tracksViewChanges={false}
    tappable={true}
    {...(IS_ANDROID ? { image: spawnMarkerImageAndroid } : {})}
  >
    {!IS_ANDROID ? (
      <Image
        source={spawnMarkerImage}
        style={styles.spawnMarkerImage}
        resizeMode="contain"
      />
    ) : null}
  </MarkerComponent>
);

This stops Android from using default pins and ensures our egg marker shows.

STEP 5 — FIX QUEST SPAWN MARKERS (lines ~604-641)
Apply the exact same pattern as spawns:
- Android uses image: spawnMarkerImageAndroid
- iOS keeps <Image> child

STEP 6 — FIX RAID MARKERS / NEARBY PLAYERS / QUEST MARKER (children <View> markers)
On Android: Marker children with <View> often cause performance + weird sizing. Convert to image markers.
Minimal safe approach (no redesign):
A) Create tiny static png icons for:
- raid-marker-72.png
- quest-marker-72.png
- nearby-dot-24.png (or 32)
OR if you want faster: for Android temporarily DISABLE these markers entirely until icons are ready.

Implement either:

Option 1 (Best): Add image prop for each on Android:
{...(IS_ANDROID ? { image: raidMarkerAndroid } : {})}
and gate children:
{!IS_ANDROID ? <View ...>...</View> : null}

Option 2 (Fast): Android: return null for those marker types (raids/nearby/questMarker) until assets exist, iOS unchanged.

STEP 7 — ENSURE NO DEFAULT PIN FALLBACK ON ANDROID
Default orange pins appear when Marker has no image/icon and no valid child render.
After changes, verify every Android Marker either:
- has image prop, OR
- is not rendered.

STEP 8 — DO NOT TOUCH THESE (hard constraints)
- Do NOT change HuntScreen logic, throttling, GPS logic, loading logic, spawn computation.
- Do NOT add region prop / controlled map.
- Do NOT refactor MapViewWrapper beyond marker rendering and new asset requires.
- Do NOT change iOS marker visuals (it already looks correct).
- Do NOT modify other files unless strictly needed for these assets.

STEP 9 — QUICK VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Android:
- Player marker is small, proportional, not huge.
- Spawn markers show egg art, not orange pins.
- Map interaction is smooth (no stutter from marker children).
iOS:
- No visual changes at all.

DELIVERABLE:
- Commit MapViewWrapper.tsx marker gating changes (Android image prop, iOS children).
- Add new resized assets in client/assets/hunt/.
