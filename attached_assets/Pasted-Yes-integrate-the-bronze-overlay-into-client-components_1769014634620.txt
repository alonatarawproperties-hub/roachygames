Yes, integrate the bronze overlay into `client/components/CameraEncounter.tsx`.

TASK
Upgrade the AR catching UI overlay to a more “gamey” premium HUD that matches our app theme: smoked obsidian glass + burnished bronze/amber accents. Overlay only (do NOT change the egg/target rendering logic). Implement as a reusable component inside CameraEncounter or extracted to a new component file if cleaner.

FILES
- AR catching screen: `client/components/CameraEncounter.tsx`
- Theme tokens: `client/constants/theme.ts`

1) THEME: add Obsidian Bronze AR tokens to `client/constants/theme.ts`
Add/extend a theme section (exported constants) for:
- Colors:
  obsidian: #0B0B0D
  obsidianBrown: #120E0B
  smokedGlass: rgba(20,14,11,0.55)
  smokedGlassStrong: rgba(20,14,11,0.72)
  bronze: #B07A3A
  amber: #E0A15A
  bronzeGlow: rgba(176,122,58,0.35)
  textPrimary: rgba(255,255,255,0.92)
  textMuted: rgba(255,255,255,0.70)
- Radii: 14, 18, 24
- Stroke widths: 1, 1.5
- Shadows: soft warm shadow presets (no harsh black)
Keep naming consistent with existing theme.ts conventions.

2) COMPONENT: implement a “gamey HUD overlay” for catching
Create a component `CatchingHUDOverlay` (inline in CameraEncounter.tsx or new file `client/components/CatchingHUDOverlay.tsx` if preferred).
Props:
- title: string (e.g., “Mystery Egg”)
- distanceText: string (e.g., “21m”)
- statusText?: string default “CATCHING…”
- onClose: () => void
- visible?: boolean default true

Overlay layout (9:16, safe-area aware):
TOP HUD ROW
- Top-left: close (X) button in smoked-glass pill/circle (hit area >= 44x44)
- Top-center: title pill (smoked glass) with small bronze icon + title text
- Top-right: distance pill with nav/arrow icon + distanceText

CENTER HUD (MORE GAMEY TARGET SYSTEM)
Use `react-native-svg` to draw:
- 3–4 concentric rings (thin bronze strokes) with dashed segments
- micro tick marks around ring edges
- a partial highlighted “lock arc” segment
- a small orbit ring of bronze dots implying scan progress
- subtle corner brackets (4 corners) framing the central area
All lines thin, crisp, bronze/amber, minimal bloom. The center must remain open for the egg/target.

BOTTOM HUD
- Bottom-center smoked-glass rounded panel
- a premium segmented spinner/progress arc above the label
- text exactly: “CATCHING…” (only text here)
Bronze glow, readable, minimal bloom.

IMPORTANT: Set overlay elements to `pointerEvents="none"` except the close button (so it doesn’t block camera gestures if any).

3) ANIMATION (AAA but lightweight)
Prefer Reanimated if already in project; otherwise Animated API (useNativeDriver where possible).
- Reticle pulse: outward pulse (scale + opacity) every ~1.2s
- Orbit dots: slow rotation 8–12s per full rotation
- Lock arc shimmer: subtle sweep highlight every ~2s (opacity gradient or moving dash offset)
- Dust motes: subtle drifting particles (very low count, not noisy; can be a few Animated Views)
- Status spinner: continuous rotation
Must run smoothly on mid-range devices.

4) INTEGRATION into `CameraEncounter.tsx`
- Keep existing camera + egg/target rendering intact.
- Mount `<CatchingHUDOverlay />` above the camera/target layers.
- Wire `onClose` to existing close/back handler.
- Pass real title/distance if available; otherwise use placeholders but keep prop structure.

5) ACCEPTANCE
- Looks more “gamey” and premium than current overlay
- Bronze/obsidian matches rest of app
- No notch overlap (use safe-area insets)
- No egg/target changes
- Animations smooth, no heavy CPU/GPU load

Return:
- Updated `theme.ts`
- Updated `CameraEncounter.tsx`
- Any new component file if created
- Short notes on where to tweak sizes (reticle radius, stroke width, glow intensity)
