Task: Redesign the “Fusion Success” screen to look premium + gameified (not generic). Add background, aura FX, particles, rarity visuals, and better layout. Keep code clean, performant, and consistent with our Roachy Hunt UI style.

CONTEXT
We have a screen that currently shows:
- Egg image in center
- “FUSION SUCCESS”
- “+1 RARE EGG”
But it looks like generic placeholder (flat rings, bland background).

GOAL (VISUAL)
Make it feel like a real game reward screen:
1) Background:
   - Deep space gradient (dark navy -> purple/blue)
   - Subtle animated vignette glow behind the egg
   - Soft noise/grain overlay (very subtle)
2) Center reward pedestal:
   - Egg floats (gentle up/down)
   - Behind it: 3 aura rings (outer ring slow rotate, inner ring pulse, mid ring shimmer)
   - Add “spark” particles that drift outward from the egg (10–20 particles)
   - Add a soft spotlight cone behind egg (radial gradient)
3) Reward text:
   - Title: “FUSION SUCCESS” with glow + slight letter spacing
   - Subtext: “+1 RARE EGG” inside a glass pill badge
   - Rarity color mapping:
       common: gray/white
       rare: blue
       epic: purple
       legendary: gold
   - The aura + title glow should match rarity color
4) Buttons:
   - Primary: “CONTINUE” (or “Back to Eggs” whichever exists)
   - Secondary: “View Inventory”
   - Use premium gradients, rounded corners, and subtle press animation
5) Performance:
   - Use react-native-reanimated for float/pulse/rotate
   - Keep particles lightweight (no heavy libs)
   - Avoid excessive re-renders

IMPLEMENTATION
1) Find the Fusion success screen component. Likely file names: 
   - client/screens/FusionSuccessScreen.tsx
   - client/screens/FusionResultScreen.tsx
   - client/components/FusionSuccessModal.tsx
Search for text “FUSION SUCCESS” or “Fusion success”.
2) Refactor into a structured layout:
   <View style={styles.container}>
     <AnimatedBackground ... />
     <RewardStage rarity="rare">
        <EggHero rarity="rare" eggImage={...} />
     </RewardStage>
     <RewardText ... />
     <Actions ... />
   </View>

3) Create small components (same file or /client/components/):
   - EggHero.tsx: floating egg + glow + aura rings
   - ParticleBurst.tsx: lightweight particles using reanimated + random positions
   - RewardBackdrop.tsx: gradient + vignette + noise overlay

4) Add a “rarityTheme” helper:
   const rarityTheme = {
     common: { glow:"#C9CED6", accent:"#E6E8EC" },
     rare: { glow:"#4DA3FF", accent:"#3B82F6" },
     epic: { glow:"#B56CFF", accent:"#8B5CF6" },
     legendary: { glow:"#FFCC4D", accent:"#F59E0B" },
   }

5) Make the aura rings:
   - Outer ring: rotate infinite (duration 10–14s)
   - Mid ring: shimmer pulse opacity (0.25 -> 0.5)
   - Inner ring: scale pulse (0.98 -> 1.05)
Use reanimated shared values + withRepeat(withTiming()).

6) Background:
   - Use LinearGradient (expo-linear-gradient)
   - Add a large radial “glow” behind egg using a View with big borderRadius and opacity.
   - Add subtle noise: a semi-transparent PNG if we already have one; if none, create a soft dotted overlay using tiny repeating pattern OR skip noise if no asset exists.

7) Make it responsive:
   - Center stage should scale on small screens
   - Use Dimensions width to compute egg size (ex: 160–220)
   - Ensure safe-area padding

8) Provide final output:
   - Show me the updated file(s)
   - Confirm where to tweak rarity and text values
   - Ensure no TypeScript errors

IMPORTANT
- Do NOT change business logic for fusion result; only UI/animation.
- Keep it consistent with the rest of the app’s typography/components (ThemedText etc if we use it).
- If the current egg image is static, keep it. Just make the visuals around it premium.
