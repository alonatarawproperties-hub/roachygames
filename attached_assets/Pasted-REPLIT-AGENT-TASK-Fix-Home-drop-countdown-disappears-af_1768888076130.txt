REPLIT AGENT TASK: Fix “Home drop countdown disappears after Hot Drop activation” by changing Area Cleared banner gating from raw spawns.length to effective in-radius/catchable spawns count.

Problem
- In HuntScreen.tsx, showBannerRaw uses: spawns.length < 2.
- After activating hotdrop, API can return 2-3 spawns (hotdrop markers/cached/home spawns) even when user has no catchable spawn in radius.
- This makes spawns.length >= 2 and hides banner, so Home Drop countdown row disappears, even though the area is actually empty.

Goal
- Banner should display when the player has no *effective* spawns in their hunting radius.
- “Effective spawn” = active, not expired, distance <= radius (same radius used in /api/hunt/spawns call, currently 500m), and not already caught/claimed if such flag exists.

Implement:

1) In client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx
A) Define a constant used by both fetch + banner logic:
const HUNT_RADIUS_M = 500;

B) After you map spawns with distance (you already compute distance for mappedSpawns), compute:
const effectiveSpawns = useMemo(() => {
  return (spawnsData || []).filter((s: any) => {
    const dist = typeof s.distance === "number" ? s.distance : null;
    if (dist == null) return true; // fallback: if no distance, treat as visible
    if (dist > HUNT_RADIUS_M) return false;
    // If fields exist, filter non-catchable:
    if (s.isActive === false) return false;
    if (s.expiresAt && new Date(s.expiresAt).getTime() <= Date.now()) return false;
    if (s.caughtByWallet) return false;
    return true;
  });
}, [spawnsData]);

const effectiveSpawnCount = effectiveSpawns.length;

C) Replace the banner condition:
OLD:
const showBannerRaw = spawnsLoaded && !spawnsFetching && hasCountdownData && spawns.length < 2;

NEW:
const showBannerRaw =
  spawnsLoaded &&
  !spawnsFetching &&
  hasCountdownData &&
  effectiveSpawnCount === 0;

D) Keep your MIN_VISIBLE_MS latch logic unchanged.

E) Add a temporary debug log when banner hides:
console.log("[BannerDBG]", { hasCountdownData, spawnsLen: spawns.length, effectiveSpawnCount, hotdropActive: !!huntMeta?.hotdrop?.active, homeCountdown });

2) Ensure the radius used here matches your query radius (you set radius=500 in fetch route string). Use the same constant so they can’t drift.

3) Do NOT change server logic, quest logic, security logic.

Verification
- Activate Hot Drop
- If no in-radius spawns are shown/catchable, banner MUST remain visible and show “Next Home Drop in …” row.
- If 1+ spawns are truly within 500m, banner can hide.
