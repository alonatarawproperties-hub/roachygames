REPLIT AGENT TASK: Fix “Weak GPS” stuck even outdoors by decoupling ACCEPTED tick from POST + add heartbeat accept + add debug overlay.

Background
- HuntScreen.tsx uses watchPositionAsync and sets gpsWeak when raw ticks exist but accepted ticks are stale.
- However accepted tick can remain stale if:
  (a) filters reject too many points OR
  (b) updateLocation() spam suppression skips POST and the accepted tick update is incorrectly tied to POST/updateLocation.
- Current updateLocation() in HuntContext.tsx skips POST when moved<10m and elapsed<10s.
Goal
- Accepted tick must update whenever we accept a location from GPS (even stationary).
- POST can be throttled, but should still send at least every 12s to keep server state fresh.
- Provide a small debug overlay to confirm raw/accepted/post timings and rejection reasons.

DO THIS EXACTLY:

1) client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx
A) Add refs for timestamps:
- lastRawTickRef (ms)
- lastAcceptedTickRef (ms)
- lastPostTickRef (ms)  // when we actually POSTed location
Initialize them to 0.

B) On EVERY watchPosition callback (raw tick), set:
- lastRawTickRef.current = Date.now()

C) ACCEPTANCE RULES (keep your existing anti-teleport/accuracy rules, but ensure heartbeat):
- Define HEARTBEAT_MS = 8000
- Define POST_MIN_INTERVAL_MS = 12000
- We consider a GPS point “acceptable” if:
  - accuracy <= 120 (hard reject only if >120)
  - teleport reject based on SPEED:
      speed = distM / dtSec
      reject if speed > 12
      reject if speed > 6 AND accuracy > 50
  - Otherwise accept if ANY of these:
      (i) distM >= dynamicMinMove
      (ii) accuracy improved a lot
      (iii) (Date.now() - lastAcceptedTickRef.current) >= HEARTBEAT_MS AND accuracy <= 35
  dynamicMinMove:
    - if accuracy<=15 => 4
    - if accuracy<=30 => 6
    - else => 10

D) IMPORTANT: When a point is ACCEPTED:
- set lastAcceptedTickRef.current = Date.now()
- setGpsStale(false)
- update any “accepted age” state used for UI badge (if you have it)
- then call updateLocation(lat,lng,heading, { forcePost?: boolean })

E) Ensure gpsWeak derives from ticks properly:
- gpsNoSignal = (Date.now() - lastRawTickRef.current) > 30000 OR permissionDenied
- gpsWeak = !gpsNoSignal AND (Date.now() - lastAcceptedTickRef.current) > 15000
This means: raw alive but we haven’t accepted any usable point for 15s.

F) POST THROTTLING (this is key):
- Even if accepted happened, we only POST when:
  (Date.now() - lastPostTickRef.current) >= POST_MIN_INTERVAL_MS OR forcePost=true
- If we POST, set lastPostTickRef.current = Date.now()

G) Add reject reason counters + log every 25 raw ticks:
Counters:
- rejBadAcc, rejTeleport, rejJitter, accMove, accHeartbeat, posted
Log:
console.log("[GPSDBG]", { acc, distM, dtSec, speed, gpsNoSignal, gpsWeak, lastRawAgeSec, lastAcceptedAgeSec, lastPostAgeSec, counters })

2) client/context/HuntContext.tsx
Modify updateLocation signature to accept an optional options param:
updateLocation(latitude, longitude, heading?, opts?: { forcePost?: boolean })

Inside updateLocation, change spam suppression:
- Keep existing skip rule, BUT:
  - If opts?.forcePost is true -> DO NOT skip.
  - Also: if elapsed >= 12000ms -> DO NOT skip (allow periodic keepalive even stationary).

So:
if (!opts?.forcePost && prev && moved < 10 && elapsed < 10000) return;
(AND add: if elapsed >= 12000, allow post)

3) Ensure MapViewWrapper badge uses gpsNoSignal + gpsWeak props (already done), but make sure it is using the NEW gpsWeak value (accepted tick based), not old gpsStale based.

4) Add a small debug overlay ON-SCREEN (temporary)
In HuntScreen.tsx (or existing HuntDebugOverlay), show:
- Raw age (sec)
- Accepted age (sec)
- Post age (sec)
- Last accuracy
- gpsWeak/gpsNoSignal booleans
This allows visual confirmation without Xcode logs.

5) Verification steps
- Stand outside, don’t move:
  - raw age should stay low (ticks coming)
  - accepted age should NEVER exceed 15s; should refresh at least every 8s (heartbeat)
  - badge should not stay “Weak”
- Walk a bit: accepted should update normally
- Indoors: likely Weak (fine)

Do not modify gameplay logic, catch logic, security logic, or server endpoints. Only GPS tracking + updateLocation throttling + debug overlay.

Implement now.
