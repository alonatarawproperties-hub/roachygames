REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (ONE-CLICK) — FIX: “Hot Drop LIVE but no spawn on map” + make quest spawns always visible

GOAL
Hot Drop / Micro Hotspot / Legendary Beacon spawns must appear on the map whenever meta.hotdrop/quest says ACTIVE. Current bug: server query filters `isActive = true` but hotspot eggs are being inserted with `isActive` NULL or false, so query returns 0 even though hotdrop is LIVE.

RULES
- Make ONLY the changes listed below.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Keep all existing response shapes (`meta.hotdrop`, `meta.quest`) intact.
- Add logs ONLY around quest spawn selection if needed.

STEP 1 — SERVER: Fix quest spawn SELECT to allow isActive NULL rows
File: server/hunt-routes.ts
Find the query that loads quest spawns (the one currently like):
  eq(wildCreatureSpawns.isActive, true),
  isNull(wildCreatureSpawns.caughtByWallet),
  gte(wildCreatureSpawns.expiresAt, now),
  eq(wildCreatureSpawns.sourceKey, questMeta.key),
  eq(wildCreatureSpawns.sourceType, questMeta.type)

Change ONLY the `isActive` filter to allow TRUE OR NULL:
- Ensure `or` is imported from drizzle-orm.

Exact patch:

1) At top imports (where drizzle-orm imports are):
Add `or` if missing:
  import { and, or, eq, isNull, gte, ... } from "drizzle-orm";

2) Replace the `eq(isActive,true)` line with:
  or(
    eq(wildCreatureSpawns.isActive, true),
    isNull(wildCreatureSpawns.isActive)
  ),

So final WHERE becomes:

const rawQuestSpawns = await db.select().from(wildCreatureSpawns)
  .where(and(
    or(
      eq(wildCreatureSpawns.isActive, true),
      isNull(wildCreatureSpawns.isActive)
    ),
    isNull(wildCreatureSpawns.caughtByWallet),
    gte(wildCreatureSpawns.expiresAt, now),
    eq(wildCreatureSpawns.sourceKey, questMeta.key),
    eq(wildCreatureSpawns.sourceType, questMeta.type)
  ))
  .limit(20);

STEP 2 — SERVER: Ensure hotspot eggs are inserted with isActive: true
File: server/hunt-routes.ts
Endpoint: POST /api/hunt/hotspot/activate (the cluster egg insert loop)

Find the db.insert(wildCreatureSpawns).values({ ... }) for quest eggs (HOT_DROP / MICRO_HOTSPOT / LEGENDARY_BEACON).
Add this field inside the inserted values object:
  isActive: true,

Do not change any other inserted fields.

STEP 3 — OPTIONAL (BUT RECOMMENDED): One-time backfill for existing NULL isActive quest eggs
If your stack supports running raw SQL or drizzle sql execution, do it once.
- If you have a migrations folder, create a single migration “backfill_quest_spawns_is_active.sql”.
- Otherwise run via your DB admin console.

SQL:

UPDATE wildCreatureSpawns
SET isActive = true
WHERE sourceType IN ('HOT_DROP','MICRO_HOTSPOT','LEGENDARY_BEACON')
  AND (isActive IS NULL OR isActive = false)
  AND caughtByWallet IS NULL
  AND expiresAt > NOW();

STEP 4 — VERIFY (MUST DO)
1) Trigger a Hot Drop (clear area until meta.hotdrop.active = true).
2) Call GET /api/hunt/spawns with same lat/lng.
3) Confirm response contains:
   - meta.hotdrop.active = true
   - and spawns array includes at least 1 spawn with sourceType = 'HOT_DROP' and sourceKey matching activeQuestKey
4) In app, confirm the hot drop cluster marker(s) appear on the map.

STEP 5 — SAFETY CHECK
- Do NOT touch HOME spawns logic except these filters.
- Do NOT change client MapViewWrapper marker rendering.

DELIVERABLE
Commit these exact changes. If any TypeScript error appears due to missing import, fix ONLY by adjusting drizzle-orm import list (add `or`).
