Replit Agent: CHANGE HOME DROP / CATCH RADIUS TO 50m (UI + LOGIC)

Goal:
- The visible circle radius must be 50 meters (not 500m).
- The “in range / move closer” logic must match the same 50m.
- Use ONE constant so UI and logic never drift again.

Step 1) Add shared constants
Create or edit file: client/lib/hunt-constants.ts

Add:
export const HOME_DROP_RADIUS_M = 50;      // visible home circle
export const CATCH_RADIUS_M = 50;          // spawn catchable distance
export const UI_NEARBY_RADIUS_M = 50;      // “egg nearby” messaging threshold

Step 2) Update the Map circle to use the constant
File: client/components/MapViewWrapper.tsx

- Import:
import { HOME_DROP_RADIUS_M } from "@/lib/hunt-constants";

- Change Circle radius:
radius={HOME_DROP_RADIUS_M}
(Replace any hardcoded 500.)

Step 3) Update any “move within 100m” / distance gating to match 50m
File: client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx

- Import:
import { CATCH_RADIUS_M, UI_NEARBY_RADIUS_M } from "@/lib/hunt-constants";

- Find any hardcoded values like:
  100
  110
  50
  500
  "within 100m"
  "closest:"
  "move closer"
  "egg visible"
  "egg nearby"

- Replace logic thresholds:
  - Any check like: if (distanceM <= 100) => if (distanceM <= CATCH_RADIUS_M)
  - Any check like: if (distanceM <= 100) for UI => if (distanceM <= UI_NEARBY_RADIUS_M)

- Update the UI text to reflect 50m:
  Change "move within 100m" to `move within ${CATCH_RADIUS_M}m`
  Ensure “closest: Xm” remains computed.

Step 4) Ensure server/client filtering uses the same 50m (if present)
Search in client + server for:
  radius=500
  radius=100
  radius=50
  CATCH_RADIUS
  HOME_DROP
  getDistance
  haversine

If there is a client filter that decides which spawns are catchable/visible,
it must use CATCH_RADIUS_M (50m), not 100m or 500m.

Step 5) Quick safety
- Do NOT change spawn generation yet.
- Only change radius constants + checks + copy text.

Expected outcome:
- The map circle becomes small (50m).
- Any “egg visible/nearby” messages and catch gating match 50m exactly.
- No more mismatch where circle says one thing and UI says another.
