Replit Agent: FIX "Hot Drop not appearing after clearing Home Drop" (Decouple UI + Force refresh)

Problem:
After clearing Home Drop, the UI shows "No eggs in range" and the Hot Drop offer row doesn't appear.
Cause is usually UI gating: Quest Offers (Hot Drop/Micro/Beacon) is hidden when eggsInRange == 0 or when a derived boolean is false (ex: homeDropActive), even though Hot Drop should still be offered.

GOAL:
1) Hot Drop offer must be visible whenever it is AVAILABLE by server state, regardless of eggsInRange.
2) After every successful catch/claim, immediately refresh Phase1 state + nodes + spawns so offers update in the same second.
3) If Hot Drop is not yet available, show the cooldown / next hot drop timer (instead of hiding the offer UI).

STEP A — Add a single source of truth for offers (Phase1)
Search in client for any Phase1 query/state (usually react-query keys like "/api/hunt/phase1" or "/api/hunt/phase1/state").
If missing, create a query in HuntScreen that fetches Phase1 state:
- GET /api/hunt/phase1 (or existing endpoint that returns: homeDropRemaining, nextHomeDropAt, hotDropAvailable, nextHotDropAt, activeOffers[])

Expected shape (use what server already has; if not present, add client-side derived defaults):
type Phase1State = {
  homeDropRemaining?: number;
  nextHomeDropAt?: string|number|null;
  hotDropAvailable?: boolean;
  nextHotDropAt?: string|number|null;
  offers?: Array<{ type: "HOT_DROP"|"MICRO"|"BEACON"; available: boolean; reason?: string; distanceM?: number; expiresAt?: any }>;
};

STEP B — NEVER gate Quest Offers UI behind eggsInRange
In client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx:
Find the section that renders:
- "Quest Offers" row
- Buttons: Micro / Hot Drop / Beacon
It is currently likely wrapped in something like:
  {eggsInRange > 0 && (...offers...)}
or
  {hasEggsNearby && (...offers...)}

CHANGE IT:
Render Quest Offers based on Phase1 state, NOT eggsInRange.

Implementation:
- Compute:
const offers = phase1?.offers ?? [];
const hasAnyOffer = offers.length > 0;
const hot = offers.find(o => o.type === "HOT_DROP");
const hotAvailable = !!hot?.available;

- Render rule:
Show Quest Offers if (hasAnyOffer) OR (phase1 has next timers):
  if (hasAnyOffer || phase1?.nextHotDropAt || phase1?.nextHomeDropAt) render the offers container.

- If hotAvailable is false, show a disabled Hot Drop button with a small subtext like:
  "Next Hot Drop in: mm:ss" (based on phase1.nextHotDropAt)
DO NOT hide the row.

STEP C — Force refresh after successful catch (this is the big one)
In client/screens/HuntScreen.tsx inside handleStartCatch, on success branch (result.eggRarity):
Right after you close encounter + setCollectedEggInfo, FORCE refetch:

Add (using queryClient):
await Promise.allSettled([
  queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/hunt/phase1"] }),
  queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/hunt/nodes"], exact: false }),
  queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/map/nodes"], exact: false }),
  queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/hunt/spawns"], exact: false }),
  queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/hunt/me"] }),
  queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/hunt/economy"], exact: false }),
]);

Do this EVEN if you already invalidateQueries — refetch is immediate, invalidate is lazy.

STEP D — If Home Drop is completed, do NOT show “No eggs in range” as the primary state
The banner "No eggs in range" is confusing if Hot Drop is available or pending.
Change messaging priority:

In HuntScreen banner logic:
- If hotAvailable => show "Hot Drop available!" (or show offer row prominently)
- Else if phase1.nextHotDropAt exists => show "Next Hot Drop in mm:ss"
- Else if phase1.nextHomeDropAt exists => show "Next Home Drop in mm:ss"
- Else fallback to "No eggs in range"

This prevents the UI from looking “dead” after clearing home drops.

STEP E — Add debug logs so we can prove it’s fixed
Add logs in HuntScreen when Phase1 changes:
console.log("[PHASE1]", JSON.stringify(phase1));
console.log("[OFFERS]", offers);

Expected outcome:
- After clearing Home Drop, within 1 second the UI updates and Hot Drop offer appears (or shows a countdown).
- No more “No eggs in range” hiding the entire offer row.
- Catching triggers immediate state refresh, no waiting.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT change spawn generation logic in this task.
Only fix UI gating + refetch behavior and correct banner priority based on Phase1 state.
