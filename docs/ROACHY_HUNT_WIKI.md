# ROACHY HUNT: PHASE I
## Official Game Wiki

---

# Welcome, Seeker

Roachy Hunt is a location-based egg-hunting experience where you discover, capture, and fuse mysterious eggs across the real world. Phase I focuses on building your egg collection through exploration, strategic fusion, and daily consistency.

**No fake rewards. No token promises. Just pure hunting.**

# THE HUNT

## Your Home Zone

When you open Roachy Hunt, the game establishes your **Home Zone**—a 50-meter radius centered on your starting location. This is your primary hunting ground.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Home Zone Radius | 50 meters |
| Spawn Cluster Radius | 500 meters from your position |
| Active Spawns (max) | 5 eggs at once |
| Spawn Refresh | Every 4 minutes (drip system) |

Eggs appear as glowing markers on your map. Walk within range, tap to engage, and capture them through the AR camera interface.

## Spawn Behavior

Eggs don't sit still. They spawn, drift, and eventually expire. The system uses a **drip model**—new eggs appear periodically rather than all at once.

**Session Rules:**
- Your Home Zone locks when you first open the app each day
- Spawns generate within 100m of your current position
- Maximum 6 active spawns at any time
- Spawns expire after 20 minutes if uncollected
- 30-minute cooldown after collecting all spawns before new wave

# EGG RARITY

## The Four Tiers

Every egg belongs to one of four rarity tiers. Rarer eggs are harder to find but essential for fusion progression.

### Common (Gray)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Color | #9CA3AF |
| Base Spawn Rate | 85% |
| Pity Timer | None |

The foundation of your collection. Common eggs fuel the fusion economy and can be recycled for Warmth.

### Rare (Cyan)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Color | #00D9FF |
| Base Spawn Rate | 12% |
| Pity Timer | Guaranteed every 20 catches |

Your first stepping stone to higher tiers. Rare eggs indicate you're hunting effectively.

### Epic (Purple)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Color | #9B59B6 |
| Base Spawn Rate | 2.8% |
| Pity Timer | Guaranteed every 60 catches |

Significant finds. Epic eggs are the gateway to Legendary fusion.

### Legendary (Gold)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Color | #FFD700 |
| Base Spawn Rate | 0.2% |
| Pity Timer | Guaranteed every 500 catches |

The ultimate prize. Legendary eggs are rare enough that finding one naturally is a genuine achievement.

## Mystery Eggs

Before capture, all eggs appear as **Mystery Eggs**—obsidian shells with glowing golden question marks. You won't know the rarity until you successfully catch it. This keeps every encounter exciting.

---

# CAPTURING EGGS

## The AR Camera

When you tap a spawn marker, the AR Camera activates. The egg materializes in your real environment through your phone's camera.

## The Catcher Disc

Your capture tool is the **Catcher Disc**—a golden targeting reticle that follows your screen position. Align it with the egg and tap to initiate capture.

## Egg Movement

Eggs don't stay still. They drift and dodge based on rarity:

| Rarity | Movement | Pattern |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Common | Slow | Gentle drift |
| Rare | Moderate | Curved paths |
| Epic | Fast | Erratic movement |
| Legendary | Variable | Unpredictable |


# FUSION

## The Core Loop

Fusion is how you upgrade your collection. Combine multiple eggs of one tier to create a higher-tier egg.

## Fusion Recipes

| Input | Quantity | Output | Success Rate |
|-------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Common | 5 | Rare | 100% |
| Rare | 20 | Epic | 15% |
| Epic | 30 | Legendary | 5% |

### Important Notes:
- **Common → Rare**: Guaranteed success. This is your primary progression path.
- **Rare → Epic**: Only 15% success rate. Failed fusions consume your eggs.
- **Epic → Legendary**: Only 5% success rate. High risk, ultimate reward.

## Fusion Strategy

The math matters:
- To guarantee 1 Rare: Need 5 Common (100% success)
- To expect 1 Epic: Need ~133 Rare attempts (15% rate) = 665 Common equivalent
- To expect 1 Legendary: Need ~600 Epic attempts (5% rate) = massive collection

**Bottom line**: Legendary eggs through fusion require dedication measured in weeks or months. Finding one naturally is faster but extremely rare.

# HOTSPOT QUESTS

Beyond your Home Zone, three quest types offer enhanced hunting opportunities.

## Micro Hotspot

*Quick walk, quick rewards*

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Distance | 150–450 meters from you |
| Duration | 12 minutes |
| Cooldown | 10 minutes |
| Cluster Size | 2 eggs |
| Rarity Rates | 75% Rare, 25% Epic |

Micro Hotspots appear close by and contain guaranteed Rare/Epic eggs. Perfect for quick breaks or short walks.

## Hot Drop

*The main event*

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Distance | 300–1,200 meters from you |
| Duration | 12–22 minutes (dynamic) |
| Cooldown | 25 minutes |
| Cluster Size | 3–5 eggs |
| Rarity Rates | 65% Rare, 34% Epic, 1% Legendary |

Hot Drops are your best hunting opportunity. They require a real walk but reward with multiple high-rarity eggs. The dynamic duration extends if you're making progress.

## Legendary Beacon

*Daily pilgrimage*

The Beacon is your daily quest. Travel to a distant location, collect 5 eggs within the zone, then claim your reward. The claim has a 30% chance of granting a Legendary egg directly.


## Daily Cap

You can only collect a limited number of eggs per day. This cap increases with your level and streak.

A Level 10 Hunter with a 14-day streak can collect up to 58 eggs daily.

## Streak System

Consecutive hunting days multiply your rewards:

| Streak Length | XP Multiplier |
